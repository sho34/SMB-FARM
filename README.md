****************SMB FARM SUITE****************<br>
> Done by Kimberly Mutanga

##Project Overview
<p>This is a Python-based desktop application built to explore GUI development using Python. Initially envisioned as a commercial product, the project evolved into an educational exercise serving as a hands-on learning experience in building functional desktop software.<p>

<p> While it may not follow the conventions of professional software engineering, it reflects the journey of learning, experimenting, and improving. Think of it as a "bad boy" with good intentions.<p>

##What it does<br>
The SMB Farm Application is designed to help manage cattle on a small-to-medium-sized farm. Key features include:

- 📁 Save Search Results Export filtered cattle records to CSV or Excel for easy reporting and analysis.

- 📊 Health Trend Tracker Monitor herd health trends over a selected time period to identify patterns and potential issues.

- 🔍 Search & Filter Tools Quickly locate specific cattle records based on tags, health status, or vaccination history.

- 🧠 Educational Value Demonstrates how to build a GUI app using Python, with real-world agricultural data as context.
